## The "Do Whatever You Want" License

Hey there! This is Tupynambá Lucas, and I'm stoked you're checking out my project.

The spirit of this license is simple: **do whatever you want with this code**. Seriously. You can use it, change it, share it, sell it, or even print it out and hang it on your wall. No restrictions.

The formal legal stuff below is the MIT License, which is just a fancy way of saying the same thing while protecting me from liability. It's one of the most permissive open-source licenses out there.

Have fun, build cool stuff, and maybe give a shout-out to **tupynambalucas.dev** if you feel like it!
